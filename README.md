# ResumeProjects
These are the projects I have on my resume

CWEC_Weakness_Analysis
- This project was very recently started as a challenge from my Elementary data structures professor.
The purpose of the project is to gain an understanding of the Weaknesses XML File created by the organization MITRE.
I am currently working on proper reading of the File by making use of file indexing and a random access file which allows me to read any specific section of the file into memory.
The project is currently only reading the header of each weakness and an little bit of info for each one.
I want to eventually create an interactive display that allows for searching for specific weakness in the file and proper displaying of each one individually, while also displaying information it has incommon with other weaknesses effectively grouping them together.
